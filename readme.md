## Usage

Make a GET request to the API to get some eCivis Data Integration to get some transactions that are somewhat realistic. Use the `count` query string parameter to request more than the default number of CSV rows returned.

```shell
curl -o transactions.csv 'https://ditg.dev.ecivis.com/?count=10'
```
